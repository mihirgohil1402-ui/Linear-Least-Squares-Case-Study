# Development of a General Linear Least Squares Solver in MATLAB

## Overview
This project presents a general MATLAB-based solver for linear least squares regression of the form:

y = mx + c

The solver minimizes the total squared error to determine optimal slope and intercept values.

## Application Example
Hooke's Law (Spring Load vs Extension) was used as a validation example.

## Results
Best Fit Equation:
y = 0.1000x + 0.1000

Minimum Squared Error:
S = 0.030000
